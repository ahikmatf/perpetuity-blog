**fault**

as faulkner said, we want to love despite, not because, loving not for the virtues, but despite the facts

**beginnings**

some moments stay forever, the will slowly make us who we are

the first day of school, your first day leaving home, the first day at work, the start of relationship, and of course wedding

all the details of this beautiful day will be carried through the rest of our lives

**token**

some moments stay forever, they will slowly make us who we are

for some of you, it will become a token, and we are glad to have given something more valuable than its worth

**happiness**

its a tricky thing, happiness

fortune and fame won't guarantee it, as much as struggle and limitations won't dismiss it, for some, the most beautiful day might not bring happiness, for others, their lowest points can still be endured with a smile

unlike other moments, happiness comes from collective memories, and today, we fund happiness in every smile, every handshake, and every hug, the are all unforgettable moments for us

thank you for being here today, we love you, and you will always be remembered
